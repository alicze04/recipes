1. Chop 3-5 cloves of garlic, 3-4 thin slices of ginger, prepare about 10 sichuan peppercorns and a few dry chili flakes (or fresh chili if you like).
2. Put some oil on a pan and add the above. Fry it for a minute or so and add some light soy sauce and a tiny bit of rice vinegar.
3. Add an onion (sliced into big 'flakes'), red pepper, some small pieces of carrots and couliflower or broccoli pieces (you can blanch them in hot water first).
4. Add more soy sauce, oyster sauce, and jeera cumin seeds. 
5. Fry it and then cook it for a little bit.
